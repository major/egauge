[![Container](https://github.com/major/egauge/actions/workflows/docker-publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/major/egauge/actions/workflows/docker-publish.yml)

Container for monitoring data from an eGauge solar meter.

Run the container with the `EGAUGE_ADDRESS` environment variable set to the IP address of the eGauge meter.
Example:

```console
podman run --rm \
    -p 5000:5000 \
    -e EGAUGE_ADDRESS=192.168.10.100 \
    ghcr.io/major/egauge:latest
```

After the container starts, make an HTTP request:

```console
$ curl -s localhost:5000 | jq
{
  "current_usage": 9104,
  "from_grid": -6790,
  "from_solar": 2314
}
```

What does this data mean?

* `current_usage` is the overall electricity usage of the home
* `from_grid` measures how much electricity is coming from the grid
* `from solar` measures how much electricity is generated by the solar panels

All power is reported in watts.

The default eGauge configuration allows retrieval of this data without any authentication.
